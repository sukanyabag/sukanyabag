 🌱 I am working as a `Data Scientist` at `Genpact's AI Practice Team` while delivering cutting-edge solutions for leading clients across `Healthcare, Finance, Insurance, Retail and Manufacturing`. Primarily a member of the `Computer Vision` team, my work also expands on leveraging `NLP`, `RL` and `Generative AI` to address real-world challenges and drive innovation in this space. I have filed my first patent on `Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)` and published two research papers on [Enhancing Image Retrieval in RAG Systems](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10698598) and `Text-to-Speech` innovations at `IEEE's ICECET 2024 (Sydney)` and the `DCAL's 11th ICBAI (IIM Bangalore)` in 2024, respectively. Currently, I am focusing on R&D for advancements in Speech, Vision, and Language technologies with plans to patent our innovations and publish more of our findings at leading AI conferences!
 
 🔭 In 2022, I had a great time working as a `Summer Research Intern` at `IIIT Hyderabad`'s `LTRC (Language Technologies Research Centre)`.
              
 👯  I’m looking to collaborate on developing awesome stuffs with `Deep Learning (NLP/Vision)`, `Generative AI/ RAG`, `RLHF` , `Finetuning` and `LLMOps`.

 📈 Recent Achievement: Officially `Kaggle Kernels Expert` & `Lead AI Instructor` at `Topmate` (Top 1% in Data)!!! 😎
              
 🤣 Fun fact: There is no RL in RLHF, ifykyk! </p>
